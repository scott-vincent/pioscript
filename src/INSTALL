Installation
============
Run the self-extracting installer to uncompress and install the package.
The install script will install all the pre-requisites which are either
included in the package or are retrieved via apt-get:
   sudo bash pioscript_install

After installation you should see two new folders on your desktop. One
contains the Pibrella example scripts and one contains the scripts for
non-Pibrella users. To run a script just double-click it. To view or
change a script, right-click it and select the Leafpad editor.
