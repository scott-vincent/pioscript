# This script reads a photoresistor on InputA and OutputE.
# It constantly displays a value which represents the
# brightness of the room where 0 is completely dark and
# 100 is fully bright. The script exits when the button
# is pressed.
#
# The read_input command works by strobing the output on
# OutputE and measuring how long it takes for InputA to go
# high (a 1uF capacitor must be wired in series with the
# photoresistor). If you are using a Pibrella you should
# also place a 6.2K ohm resistor across the capacitor to
# drop the output voltage down from 5V to a safe input
# voltage.
