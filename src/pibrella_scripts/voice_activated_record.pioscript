# This script listens for some sound and then turns on the Red
# LED and starts recording when it hears some. It will turn off
# the Red LED and stop recording when there is silence for at
# least 2 seconds. The sound will then be saved and played back.
#
# If you are in a noisy room try changing the recording_level
# value from 5 to 10. Any sounds below this level are treated
# as silence and will not trigger the recording.
#
# Press Ctrl-C to stop this script.
